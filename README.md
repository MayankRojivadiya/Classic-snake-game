# 🐍 Classic Snake Game

A recreation of the classic Snake Game using **Python** and the built-in **`turtle`** graphics module. <br>
- This version includes a real-time movement of snake and tracks the **score** & **highest score** during gameplay. 
- Designed with Object-Oriented Programming using modular files for snake, food, score, and borders.

## 🕹️ Gameplay Overview

- Control the snake with arrow keys (⬆️ ⬇️ ⬅️ ➡️).
- Eat the food to grow the snake and increase your score.
- Avoid hitting the walls or your own tail.
- If you crash, the snake resets — but the **high score** remains on screen.
